### Hi, I'm Simone!
I'm a Java developer mainly focused on healthcare IT solutions in Italy. Working fully remote at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en) as a consultant.

### I enjoy designing and developing video games.
If you want to follow my work as a game developer, check out <a href="https://github.com/StampedeStudios">Stampede Games</a> and give a look at the game we recently published on Play Store: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.stampede.sumzero">Sum Zero</a>.

### Current project
I've currently started to document my learning process of the C language by writing an e-book that you can check out at: [The Bloody Way To C](https://github.com/simone-lungarella/the-bloody-way-to-c).

_cheers_.
